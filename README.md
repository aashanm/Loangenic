LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), is it possible to build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? This way, in the future when LendingClub gets a new potential customer, it can be assessed whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
